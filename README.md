# C-Projects-Beginner
This repo contains C projects from college which helped me learned C.
Such projects include:

## TSP - The Traveling Salesman Problem
Using files that represent adjacency matrices in a specified format,
The shortest path including all nodes can be found between two specified
nodes.

## RSA - Rivest Shamir Adleman public-key cryptography
Generating a public and private key, an input can be encrypted and
decrypted accordingly.

## Bloom - Bloom Filters and Hash Tables
Given text files filled with possibly bad and assuredly bad words,
text can be parsed through and such specified words can be flagged
using a Bloom Filter.

These projects were made in CSE-13S-01 during the Fall quarter of 2021,
and are NOT meant for free use and distibution.
